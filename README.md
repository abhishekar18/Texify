# Textify
 Android app to perform optical character recognition

<hr>

#Summary

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. The handwritten text is usually read from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image. 

Textify is an Android-based app which captures an image, reads the text from it and displays it, performing OCR.
